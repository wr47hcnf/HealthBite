# HealthBite

Is the name of the site three friends started working on where we are determined to revolutionize the approach to public health. Recognizing the importance of preventive measures, we initiated the implementation of a groundbreaking web app, aimed at promoting healthier choices among the population.
This project is made for the FIICode Web & Dev competition. You can find more info [here](https://fiicode-api.asii.ro/static/webdev2024)

## Key aspects

#### Backend Development in Go
The site's backend will be written in Go, a programming language known for its speed and efficiency. Go compiles directly to machine code, resulting in a fast backend, and it also supports multithreading, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks.

#### Input Sanitization & Regex Checking
To ensure data security and integrity, the site will implement input sanitization and regular expression (regex) checking. This will help prevent malicious input and enforce specific patterns for user-provided data, enhancing the overall security and reliability of the system.

#### Minimal JavaScript Usage
The site will prioritize minimal use of JavaScript to promote fast loading times and reduce client-side processing. By keeping JavaScript usage to a minimum, the site will deliver a streamlined user experience while maintaining high performance and efficient resource utilization.

## Prerequisites

To run the application smoothly, make sure to configure a PostgreSQL database with the constants set in the constants.go file.
